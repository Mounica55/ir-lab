Assignment 1: Create an inverted index from a collection of documents.

Collection: http://users.dsic.upv.es/~pgupta/clinss/downloads/hindi.12.tar.gz.gpg (GPG key: "clinss2012fire")

Tool Dependancy:

- Use any stopword list available external
- Use stemmer API if available 

From a collection, build an inverted index and store if for later use. Think of efficiency for searching on inverted index. 

I/O requirements: 

1. Output general statistics of the index like size of term list, number of documents etc.
2. For any user input term, fetch TF (collection frequency) and IDF from the index.

Extra Points: If you employ an index compression technique, 10% Extra credit.

General notes: 

- Use your software design skills as much as possible like, OOP concepts, code reusability (refactoring), documentation and unit tests.
