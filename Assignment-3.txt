Assignment 3: Implement relevance feedback 
Due: 1st Feb
Version: 3.0

Retrieve top 10 documents from the index based on their TF-IDF score.

i) Ask the user to provide relevance feedback of which are positive and which are negative. Recalculate the ranklist based on the feedback and present the results in console in following format for a given query.

<rank>\t<score>\t<docid>\t<title>

print score in .4%f format and extract title from the document runtime or store it explicitly.


ii) Do pseudo relevance feedback using Rocchio and recalculate the ranklist. Present the results as in above format.

General notes: 

- Use your software design skills as much as possible like, OOP concepts, code reusability (refactoring), documentation and unit tests.
